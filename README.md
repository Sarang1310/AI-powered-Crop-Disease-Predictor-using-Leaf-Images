# AI-powered-Crop-Disease-Predictor-using-Leaf-Images
This project leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning to detect plant diseases from leaf images. By analyzing visual patterns such as color changes, spots, or deformations, the system can predict crop diseases at an early stage and recommend eco-friendly solutions.
